# HR-Analytics
Finding suitable candidates for an open role could be a daunting task, especially when there are many applicants. It can impede team progress for getting the right person at the right time. “HR Analytics” could really ease the tedious process of fair screening and shortlisting, it would certainly expedite the candidate selection and decision making process.In this study we propose a machine learning approach which can be used as a decision support tool in the hiring process. The proposed approach comprises of two components-

--> Candidates applying for jobs- Candidates need to upload their resume. This project will extract the skills from the uploaded resume and display top 10 or 20 job postings which are the most compatible with the resume uploaded. Additionally, if the candidates don't have their resume they can build their resume in our application itself.

--> Recruitment team- Every job advertisement receives a significant number of applications, many of which are related to the listed position .Because they must identify the most qualified profile/resume from a broad pool of prospects, job recruiters encounter substantial challenges.This project eases this hectic work from the side of the recruitment also.Recruitment team member only has to enter the skills required in the candidate and it displays top 10 or 20 candidates with the required skills without going through the CVs/resumes.
